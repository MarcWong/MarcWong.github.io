          My PhD topic is visual attention modelling for optimization of information visualizations, which integrated to Project A07 in <a href="https://www.sfbtrr161.de/research/project_a07/">SFB-TRR 161</a>.
          My first research goal is acquiring large-scale humanlike attention data without eye tracking equipment on information visualizations. I turn to crowdsourcing approaches (webcam or mouse-clicking) or gaze data synthesis by generative or cognitive models. My second research goal is to computationally model human visual behaviour (saliency map, scanpath) under different tasks (top-down) in information visualizations. My third research goal is to develop a task-driven computational model to optimize information visualisation by maximising metrics (e.g. recallability, gaze uncertainty).
